Once you log in the geemail, there would be an interface which can indicate what to do, you can then send or read message to another user. What's more when you sending message you should set another password for it, and the receiver will have to input this password in order to read it.\r\n\r\n#What I learned:\r\nThis is a big project and we spends a lot of times on it.The new skill a learned is to use sqlite3 in our program, which is a very convenient tools to manage a lot of data, so we don't need to consider much about memory management. What's more, we apply many secure measures in this project, each user has its pass word and each message has its password, and we do this by hashing, this is a good experience to practice it.",
